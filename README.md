## Steganography Software

### Description

This Steganography software allows users to securely encode and decode text within images. By leveraging steganographic techniques, the software hides a user-inputted text message inside a selected image, making it invisible to unintended viewers. The encoded image can then be shared or stored, with the assurance that the embedded text remains concealed. The software also provides functionality to decrypt the image back into the original text message, ensuring easy retrieval of the hidden information.

### Features

- **Text Encoding**: Input any text and encode it seamlessly into a chosen image.
- **Image Encryption**: Utilize robust encryption to ensure the text is securely hidden within the image.
- **Text Decoding**: Decrypt the encoded image to retrieve the original text message.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for easy text and image selection.

### How to Use

1. **Encode Text into Image**:
   - Enter the text you wish to encode.
   - Select an image from your device.
   - Click on the "Encode" button to embed the text into the image.

2. **Decode Text from Image**:
   - Select the encoded image from your device.
   - Click on the "Decode" button to extract and view the hidden text.

### Use Cases

- Securely sharing sensitive information.
